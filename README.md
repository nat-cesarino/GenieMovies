# Genie Movies

An iOS app that consumes the TMDb Web API to display movies information.

In the home screen you can check the week's top trending movies at the home screen.
There, once you choose a movie, you go to the movie detail screen and you can check some information about it or save it to your favorites.
In the favorites tab you can check all your favorite marked movies or even unmark them as you wish.
In the search tab you can search for any other movie, check its details and mark it as a favorite.

It was the first personal project I built, and it is currently published in the App Store:

I hope you enjoy the app.
